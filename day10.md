<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 10</h1>

<p>This week is better than last week. While I struggled with some of the lab work, I got a lot of
help from the instructor and TAs.</p>

<p>While I'm constantly feeling behind on some of the concepts, I feel a bit more confident this
week as I have learned to ask more constructive questions and I am able to troubleshoot on my own
during lab.  What we learned in class during 10 days begins to make sense to me so it's a relief.</p>

<p>I'm still to struggling to find time to read all the assigned chapters. I tell myself that I will
catch up on weekends but as usual my weekend is filled with fixing and refining coding
assignments.</p>
