<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 1</h1>
<p> After hearing about how fast the pace of the class will be from pass alumni, I expected that today in class we would hit the ground running.
I was surprised that we spent half of the morning going through administrative things.  I do understand that it's important to level set everyone's 
expectation.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the lab portion of the class. I wasn't sure if the goal of the lab session is to not only let student practice but also exploring what's
coming up next based on what is discovered in the lab.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to learning more in the upcoming days.  I also reminded myself to think about ideas for final project.</p>
