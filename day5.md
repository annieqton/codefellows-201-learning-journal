<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 5</h1>

<p> Today has been a much better day in class. The lab assignment yesterday was straight forward so
my partner and I finished the assignment earlier than expected. I used the leftover time to continue
working on the About Me coding exercise. </p>

<p>While we're working on creating branches on GitHub today, my partner and I ran into our first
(two) merge conflicts.  With the guidance from Sam, we were able to successfully complete the
assignment on time. From this experience, I have learned what to do in the case of merge conflict
and what to look for as well as different ways of debugging. </p>
