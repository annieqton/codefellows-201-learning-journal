<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 8</h1>

<p>It's mid week of week 2 and I'm feeling like a broken train at a train station. I keep on finding
new ways to break my code.  It's incredible frustrating because each time I thought I got it, I
realized that I have to rewrite because the new code isn't going to work for the next assignment.  
The whole concept of attaching the output of a function to a form is just confusing to me.  I am a
visual learner so I need to sit down with a TA to work on the mapping of the tasks and the
outputs prior to going back in and fixing my codes. </p>

<p>I'm telling myself to hang in there and get through this hurdle this week. I believe I am
learning a lot but while I'm stuck on solving broken codes, I do not have the time to reflect on
what I have learned so far. </p>
