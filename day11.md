##LJ Code 201 - Day 11
##
What an exhausting week so far.  It's almost 4 a.m. and I've been going at it for the past 18 hours.
 As it currently stands, I still haven't been able to implement the chart in Javascript. This week
makes previous weeks feel like a cake walk. I feel like I'm drinking from a firehose. I'm not
retaining any memory from learning because most of the time is just doing the tasks repeatedly until
they work. It probably would take me about a week of going through the lecture, doing the reading and
re-writing codes several times to be able to fully undertand this part of the class.
