<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 6</h1>

p> I was hopping to catch up on my readings over the weekend but I didn't have a chance to.  I ended
up working on the coding assignments, taking quizes and the survey as well as doing the reading
assignment for the weekend. </p>

<p>Today in class we went over a lot of concept with regards to Object Literals.  I was feeling a
little behind in my understand of how it works.  The coding assignment was not at difficult as I
anticipated. I did spend a fair amount of time pseudo coding and working on different ways to write
my codes.  It is less frustrating today in lab than it has been in the past. </p>
